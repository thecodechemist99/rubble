//! The LE Security Manager protocol.
//!
//! The Security Manager is a mandatory part of BLE and is connected to L2CAP channel `0x0006` when
//! the Link-Layer connection is established.
//!
//! # BLE Security
//!
//! As is tradition, BLE security is a complexity nightmare. This section hopes to clear up a few
//! things and tries to define terms used throughout the code and specficiation.
//!
//! ## Pairing and Bonding
//!
//! * **Pairing** is the process of generating and exchanging connection-specific keys in order to
//!   accomplish an encrypted Link-Layer connection.
//!
//!   This is done by having the *Security Managers* of the devices talk to each other to perform
//!   the key exchange, and then using *LL Control PDUs* to enable the negotiated encryption
//!   parameters.
//!
//! * **Bonding** means permanently storing the shared keys derived by *Pairing* in order to reuse
//!   them for later connections.
//!
//!   The way keys are stored is inherently platform- and application-dependent, we just have to
//!   provide interfaces to export and import key sets.
//!
//! Most times, when talking about *pairing*, the *bonding* part is implied. If it were not, you
//! would constantly have to re-pair devices when reconnecting them.
//!
//! ## LE Legacy Pairing vs. LE Secure Connections
//!
//! Bluetooth's security track record is an actual record in that it is so atrociously bad that this
//! protocol should have never seen the light of the day. Alas, here we are.
//!
//! LE security is generally able to utilize *AES-128-CCM* for encryption, which isn't broken by
//! itself (unlike the "export-grade" encryption used by earlier Bluetooth versions). However, the
//! way the AES key is exchanged differs between *LE Legacy Pairing* and *LE Secure Connections*
//! pairing, which hugely impacts actual security.
//!
//! ### LE Legacy Pairing
//!
//! For BLE 4.0 and 4.1, only the *LE Legacy Pairing* (as it is now known as) was available. Like
//! every awfully designed protocol, they've rolled their own crypto and use their own key exchange
//! procedure (with the usual catastrophic consequences). First, a shared 128-bit **T**emporary
//! **K**ey (TK) is obtained, which is then used to generate the 128-bit **S**hort-**T**erm **K**ey
//! (STK) that is used to initially encrypt the connection while other keys are exchanged.
//!
//! The STK is generated from the TK by mixing in random values from master (`Mrand`) and slave
//! (`Srand`), which are exchanged in plain text. If a passive eavesdropper manages to obtain TK,
//! they only need to listen for the `Mrand` and `Srand` value and can then compute the STK and
//! decrypt the connection.
//!
//! There are 3 methods of determining the TK:
//! * *"Just Works"*: TK=0
//! * *Passkey Entry*: A 6-digit number is displayed on one device and input on the other device.
//!   The number is directly used as the TK (after zero-padding it to 128 bits).
//! * *Out-of-Band* (OOB): The 128-bit TK is provided by an external mechanism (eg. NFC).
//!
//! "Just Works" obviously is broken without any effort other than listening for the exchanged
//! `Mrand` and `Srand` values.
//!
//! The Passkey Entry method only allows 1000000 different TKs (equivalent to using 20-bit keys)
//! and does not do any key derivation. This makes it trivial to brute-force the TK by running the
//! STK derivation up to a million times.
//!
//! **The only way to perform *LE Legacy Pairing* with meaningful protection against passive
//! eavesdropping is by using a secure Out-of-Band channel for agreeing on the TK.**
//!
//! ### LE Secure Connections pairing
//!
//! Added with BLE 4.2, this finally uses established cryptography to do everything. It uses ECDH on
//! the P-256 curve (aka "secp256r1" or "prime256v1").
//!
//! Using ECDH immediately protects against passive eavesdropping. MITM-protection works similarly
//! to what *LE Legacy Pairing* attempted to do, but is actually relevant here since the base key
//! exchange isn't broken to begin with. There are several user confirmation processes that can
//! offer MITM-protection:
//!
//! * *"Just Works"*: No MITM-protection. Uses the *Numeric Comparison* protocol internally, with
//!   automatic confirmation.
//! * *Numeric Comparison*: Both devices display a 6-digit confirmation value and the user is
//!   required to compare them and confirm on each device if they're equal.
//! * *Passkey Entry*: Either a generated passkey is displayed on one device and input on the other,
//!   or the user inputs the same passkey into both devices.
//! * *Out-of-Band* (OOB): An Out-of-Band mechanism is used to exchange random nonces and confirm
//!   values. The mechanism has to be secure against MITM.
//!
//! ## LE Privacy
//!
//! BLE devices are normally extremely easy to track. Since many people use BLE devices, and device
//! addresses are device-unique, they can be very easily used to identify and track people just by
//! recording BLE advertisements.
//!
//! The LE privacy feature can prevent this by changing the device address over time. Bonded devices
//! can still *resolve* this address by using a shared **I**dentity **R**esolving **K**ey (IRK).
//!
//! This feature is not related to encryption or authentication of connections.
